# Potato Leaf Image Super-Resolution

This repository contains my undergraduate thesis project focused on image super-resolution using deep learning techniques for agricultural applications.

## Background
Accurate identification of plant diseases often relies on the quality of visual data. In real-world agricultural settings, images captured using mobile devices may suffer from low resolution, which can reduce the effectiveness of downstream analysis. This project explores the use of image super-resolution models to enhance image quality as a supporting step for plant disease identification.

## Objective
To develop and evaluate a deep learning–based image super-resolution approach that enhances the visual quality of potato leaf images, supporting more accurate identification of plant diseases.

## Methods
- *ESRGAN* for image super-resolution
- *EfficientNet-based models* for downstream experimentation
- Model training and experimentation conducted using *Google Colab*
- Data preprocessing and analysis using Python-based tools
